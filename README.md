# Train-Scheduler
The Train-Scheduler interface allows the user to determine Current Train Schedules based on user input (Train Name, Destination, First Train Time (HH:mm - military time), and Frequency (min)) and the current time.
To generate the list of Current Train Schedules, fill out all user input text boxes at the bottom of the page and click on the Submit button. Watch as each user input submission translates onto the webpage with respect to Train Name, Destination, Frequency (min), Next Arrival, and Minutes Away through synchronization with Google's Firebase Realtime Database.
Lorraine Baynosa maintains and contributes to the project.
